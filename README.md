Currently Front and backend are connected and succesfully sending data from front end and being saved to the DB.

Current goals with app -
  - Building api on server to handle delete requests from front end.
  - Configuring the front end api calls to correctly connect and delete appropriate data.
  - Research Oauth and implement some version of it on the front end and server side for security.
  - Go over the entire front ends design and refactor 90% of the site.
  - Make sure front end is responsive and all devices.
